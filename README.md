# JavaFX-Pixel-Sorter version 0.4

A simple photo editor written with JavaFX that can apply a pixel sorting algorithm on a given image file and also able to save the altered image.

Changes:
~added a input field to pass in threshold for sorting algorithms.
~added a restore image option so user can get back to the original image and apply new sort.

In order to run the Pixel Sorter Application:
- Download the "Pixel Sorter v04s.zip";
- Extract the .zip file;
- If you don't have Java JDK installed on your windows, download a Java JDK and install it.
- Java Runtime Environment is bundled with the .exe file, so you don't need to have that on your windows, 
but if get any error trying to run the .exe maybe try installing a JRE aswell. [JRE version MUST BE above 1.7]
